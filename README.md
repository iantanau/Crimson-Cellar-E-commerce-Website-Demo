# 🍷 Crimson Cellar

**Crimson Cellar** is a fully functional, PHP-based e-commerce web application designed for selling premium red wines.

This project was developed from scratch to demonstrate core full-stack web development concepts, including **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, secure session management, and MySQL database integration, without relying on high-level frameworks like Laravel or Symfony.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 💻 Technical Architecture
- **OOP Cart System:** Implements custom `Product` and `Cart` classes (`product_cart_class.php`) to encapsulate business logic and state management.
- **Security Best Practices:**
  - **Payment Tokenization Simulation:** Credit card inputs are processed via a simulated secure gateway; sensitive data (PAN/CVV) is **never** stored in the database.
  - **Input Validation:** Rigorous sanitization of user inputs to prevent SQL injection.
  - **Access Control:** Session-based authentication protecting member-only pages.

### 🛍️ E-Commerce Functionality
- **Product Catalog:** Dynamic fetching of wine details, images, and stock levels (`shop.php`).
- **Shopping Cart:** Add, remove, and update quantities dynamically using PHP Sessions.
- **Order Processing:** Complete checkout flow that records transaction history.
- **Search:** Functional search bar to filter products by name or criteria.

### 👤 User System
- **Authentication:** Registration and Login system.
- **Member Dashboard:** Users can view order history and manage profiles.
- **Admin Ready:** Database schema supports role-based extensions.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Native PHP (Procedural & OOP)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Server Environment:** Apache (via XAMPP/WAMP)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - Install **XAMPP** (or any environment with Apache & MySQL).

2.  **Database Setup:**
    - Open **phpMyAdmin** (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    - Create a new database named **`crimsondb`**.
    - Import the `crimson_cellar.sql` file located in the root/sql folder of this repository.

3.  **Configuration:**
    - Open `conn_db.php`.
    - Check the database credentials. Default XAMPP settings are usually:
      ```php
      $servername = "localhost";
      $username = "root";
      $password = ""; // Empty for XAMPP
      $dbname = "crimsondb";
      ```

4.  **Run:**
    - Clone or copy this project folder into your server's root directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\crimson-cellar`).
    - Start **Apache** and **MySQL**.
    - Visit `http://localhost/crimson-cellar/index.php` in your browser.

## ⚠️ Security Disclaimer

**This project is for educational and portfolio purposes only.**

- **Payment Safety:** The checkout process includes a **simulated** credit card form. It demonstrates data handling (masking/validation) but does **NOT** process real financial transactions. Do not enter real credit card numbers.
- **Data Storage:** The application strictly avoids storing sensitive payment information (PCI-DSS compliance simulation).
